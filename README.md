SwissPaymentSlipPdf - Swiss Payment Slips as PDFs
=================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipPdf.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipPdf)

Do you need to create Swiss payment slips (called ESR) as PDF files in a project of yours?
Then you found almost the right place, go to [SwissPaymentSlipFpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipFpdf) or [SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf).

If you want to create Swiss payment slips as PDF files in your PHP code base but don't want to use neither FPDF nor TCPDF, then you can use this project.

Background Story
----------------

In february 2013 I was looking for a solution to create swiss payment slips for a project I had to do at my work place.
After a short Google search I came accros Manuel Reinhard's [blog post](http://sprain.ch/blog/downloads/class-esr-besr-einzahlungsschein-php/) about the class he made for that.
On his [Github project's page](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php) I found [Peter Siska's](https://github.com/peschee) [pull request](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php/pull/5).
His pull request introduced PSR-0 compatibility and he created a composer package on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/).
So I tried Peter's version and it suited my basic needs.

BUT since the customer I was working for used custom designed payment slips I couldn't use Manuel's/Peter's script since it wasn't flexible enough.
Now I had to decide whether I want to "just" change the script to fit my needs or to rewrite it and make it as flexible as possible.
I decided myself for the latter.
